# AR practice

For this week's assignment, I try to learn [ARKit](https://developer.apple.com/arkit/) and [SpriteKit](https://developer.apple.com/spritekit/) by building two easy app featuring my favorite [party parrot](https://cultofthepartyparrot.com/).

To got started, I followed [this tutorial](https://www.lynda.com/iOS-tutorials/Welcome/697725/770827-4.html?autoplay=true) to understand the basic knowledge of AR and 2D game in iOS development. 

The first thing I build is this 2D AR app to create party parrot in the air:

The second is a party parrot paint brush:
